    "# SASHelper for Protein Study with SAXS and SANS Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides an introduction to two important techniques used in protein studies: Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS). Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) techniques are powerful tools used in the study of protein structure and dynamics in solution. These techniques provide valuable information about the size, shape, flexibility, and interactions of biological macromolecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAS techniques involve measuring the scattering pattern produced when a beam of X-rays or neutrons interacts with a sample. By analyzing the scattering pattern, researchers can gain insights into the structural properties of proteins and other biomolecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"small-angle\" refers to the range of scattering angles typically observed in SAS experiments. These angles correspond to scattering events that deviate only slightly from the direction of the incident beam. The scattered intensity at small angles contains information about the overall shape and size of the particles in the sample.\n",

    "SAXS is a technique used to study the scattering of X-rays by proteins in solution. It provides valuable information about the size, shape, and conformational dynamics of proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform SAXS experiments in Python, you can use the `pyFAI` library. Here's an example code snippet to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pyFAI\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load experimental data\n",
    "data = np.loadtxt('saxs_data.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a SAXS geometry\n",
    "geometry = pyFAI.geometry.Geometry()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform SAXS analysis\n",
    "result = pyFAI.saxs(data, geometry)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot the SAXS curve\n",
    "result.plot()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key principles of SAXS\n",
    "\n",
    "SAXS relies on the scattering of X-rays by the electrons in the protein sample. The scattering pattern obtained contains information about the protein's size, shape, and overall structure. By analyzing the scattering curve, various structural parameters can be derived.\n"
